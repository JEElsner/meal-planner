in no particular order, complete by priority and ease:

- recipe doubling, tripling, etc.
- number of servings consumed at a meal
- commands for recipe editing
- print out all ingredients necessary for a meal plan
- ingredients with units
- allow for leftovers
- QoL carryover from last week, i.e. if not all servings of a meal aren't used last week, add as a leftover this week
- advanced meal plan formats (calendar, single meal [e.g. Thanksgiving] with categories like main dish, salad, sides, etc.)?
- mealplan autosave
- gui
- autocomplete
- subrecipes
- actually fix the table formatting so text doesn't spill out
- gracefully handle bad args to `newplan` so it doesn't crash
